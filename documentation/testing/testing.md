## DevTools

* Testing the responsiveness of the web app.
    * As an outcome I added a number of media queries in order to ensure the website is still user friendly on different screen sizes.
    * I used Bootstrap to ensure I have reactive columns on different screen sizes.
* Testing the css is targeting the relevant html code.
    * As an outcome the webiste is responsive on all screen sizes.
* Console Debugging
    * As an outcome I was able to see whether my Javascript functions were being called and were executing properly by displaying a console.log value in my console.
    * I noted that a Favicon was missing and was able to fix this with adding a favicon script and images. 


## Manual Testing

* Landing Page
   * Verify that when the page loads it hides the meditation page `div`.
   ![Hidden Meditation Page On Load](https://github.com/Gmanprodev/SerenAppy-Web-App/blob/master/documentation/testing/test-images/hidden_meditation_page.gif?raw=true) 

   * Verify that by clicking the logo in the header it refreshes the landing page and that the nav bar is fixed when on scroll.

## Automated Testing

### Code Validation

   * I used the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate my html code.
   * I used the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/) to validate my css code.
   * I used the [Free Formatter](https://www.freeformatter.com/) website to format my html code.

### Browser Validation

   * Chrome - works correctly. Click [here](test-images/chrome_test.jpg) for the test image.
   * Explorer - works correctly. Click [here](test-images/explorer_test.jpg) for the test image.
   * Safari - works correctly. Click [here](test-images/safari_test.jpg) for the test image.

### Lighthouse Audit

   * Click [here](lighthouse_report.pdf) for the full report.
   * No reccommendations in this report have been implemented in the first release but will be looked at in future releases.

#### Conclusion

   * The code validators highlighted 2 errors:
      * Using an a tag to wrap a button - this issue has been fixed for the first release.

   * The suggestions given in the Lighthouse report will be implemented in the second release.



## User testing

### My Mentor

Generally very positive feedback and was very complimentary about the colours and how it put a smile on her face evrytime she used the website.

#### Suggested Improvements

* Change the burger menu icon to the colour Orange - implemented.
* Add left padding to the collapsed dropdown menu so the text isn't hugging the screen edge - implemented.
* In addition to the Social media icons in the footer linking to separate pages, also link the other footer info - implemented.
* Create more distance between the content and where the section border radius begins (seat), so that the border and content isn't making contact - implemented.
* Reduce the size of the image on the About Us page - implemented.
* Increase the google map size on the Location page and create @media query for smaller screen sizes - implemented.

### Peer-Code-Review

The feedback was that people enjoyed using the site and it was fun and easy to navigate. Everyone loved the colours and how if made them feel.

#### Suggested Improvements:

   * Add left paddign to the collapsed dropdown menu so the text isn't hugging the screen edge - implemented.
   * Footer Social Media links all go to the generic login pages and not the company pages - I've left this for a later release as at this moment in time the Mr Digbee business doesn't have any Social Media footprint.
   * The contact form should have more padding to allow more space between the content and the section border radius - implemented.
   * The contact form sends without a valid email address and phone number - implemented.
   * Remove the call to action (header) at the top of the servivce pages so you can immedialtely see the information you've clicked for rather than scrolling again - this is a single user prefrence and I will look to implement this on a later release once I have a larger quantity of user feedback.
   * One image on the Flowers & Trees page had a broken link and needed fixing - implemented.
   * The section border radius on all pages were blending into one another and needed space between them, the navigation bar and the footer - implemented.
   * On a mobile device in landscape orientation the content overlaps one another - I am aware of this and given there are very few users who will navigate this site in a mobile landscape orientation I will fix this in a future release.
   * On a Iphone the carousel slides the same content in twice - I am aware of this and through my research I have concluded that this is due to a bug in ios 13 and cannot be fixed at this stage.
   * The Orange and Green colours in the footer have very low contrast which could be an issue for accessability - Will look to make changes in the future releases.


### User Review

The general feedback was positive. Most people commenting on how much fun it was visually and easy to navigate.


#### Suggested Improvements:

   * Maybe better to have the Services section in the Navigation bar with the rest of the links - Will look to implement in a future release if there is enough user feedback.
   * On a mobile device in landscape orientation the content overlaps one another - I am aware of this and given there are very few users who will navigate this site in a mobile landscape orientation I will fix this in a future release.
   * On an Iphone the carousel slides the same content in twice - 

#### Conclusion

   * I am aware of the Iphone bug and through my research I have concluded that this is due to a bug in ios 13 and cannot be fixed at this stage.
   * I will use an analytics platform on the first release, such as [Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com/), to collect feedback form a larger range of users and use that data to implement changes related to the way users navigate the site.
