## DevTools

* Testing the responsiveness of the web app.
    * As an outcome I added a number of media queries in order to ensure the website is still user friendly on different screen sizes.
    * I used Bootstrap to ensure I have reactive columns on different screen sizes.
* Testing the css is targeting the relevant html code.
    * As an outcome the webiste is responsive on all screen sizes.
* Console Debugging
    * As an outcome I was able to see whether my Javascript functions were being called and were executing properly by displaying a console.log value in my console.
    * I noted that a Favicon was missing and was able to fix this with adding a favicon script and images. 


## Manual Testing

* Landing Page
   * Verify that when the page loads it hides the meditation page `div`.
   ![Hidden Meditation Page On Load](https://github.com/Gmanprodev/SerenAppy-Web-App/blob/master/documentation/testing/test-images/hidden_meditation_page.gif?raw=true) 

   * Verify that by clicking the logo in the header it refreshes the landing page and that the nav bar is fixed when on scroll.

   * Verify that the nav bar moves with the rest of the page on scroll (screen heights less than 580px to ensure there is enough content on the page at any one time).

#### Conclusion

   * I found that there were a number of images which weren't linked correctly - this issue has been fixed for the first release.
   * I found that the contact form email address field was accepting any text and not a valid email format - this issue has been fixed for the first release.
   * I found that the contact form phone number field was accepting any text and not a valid UK phone number - this issue has been fixed for the first release.



## Automated Testing

### Code Validation

   * I used the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate my html code.
   * I used the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/) to validate my css code.
   * I used the [Free Formatter](https://www.freeformatter.com/) to format my html and css code.
   * I used the [jshint](https://jshint.com/) website to validate my Javascript code.
   * I used TDD and built my own Jasmine test to test my formatTime() Javascript function, which you can access [here](https://github.com/Gmanprodev/SerenAppy-Web-App/tree/master/documentation/testing/jasmine_testing)

### Browser Validation

   * Chrome - works correctly. Click [here](test-images/chrome_test.jpg) for the test image.
   * Explorer - works correctly. Click [here](test-images/explorer_test.jpg) for the test image.
   * Safari - works correctly. Click [here](test-images/safari_test.jpg) for the test image.

### Lighthouse Audit

   * Click [here](lighthouse_report.pdf) for the full report.
   * No reccommendations in this report have been implemented in the first release but will be looked at in future releases.

#### Conclusion

   * The code validators highlighted 2 errors:
      * Using an a tag to wrap a button - this issue has been fixed for the first release.
      * Missing a h1 tag inside a new section - this issue has been fixed for the first release. 
   * The carousel issue in the Opera browser will be looked at in future releases.
   * The suggestions given in the Lighthouse report will be implemented in the second release.



## User testing

### My Mentor

Generally very positive feedback and was very complimentary about the colours and how it put a smile on her face evrytime she used the website.

#### Suggested Improvements

* Change the burger menu icon to the colour Orange - implemented.
* Add left padding to the collapsed dropdown menu so the text isn't hugging the screen edge - implemented.
* In addition to the Social media icons in the footer linking to separate pages, also link the other footer info - implemented.
* Create more distance between the content and where the section border radius begins (seat), so that the border and content isn't making contact - implemented.
* Reduce the size of the image on the About Us page - implemented.
* Increase the google map size on the Location page and create @media query for smaller screen sizes - implemented.

### Peer-Code-Review

The feedback was that people enjoyed using the site and it was fun and easy to navigate. Everyone loved the colours and how if made them feel.

#### Suggested Improvements:

   * Add left paddign to the collapsed dropdown menu so the text isn't hugging the screen edge - implemented.
   * Footer Social Media links all go to the generic login pages and not the company pages - I've left this for a later release as at this moment in time the Mr Digbee business doesn't have any Social Media footprint.
   * The contact form should have more padding to allow more space between the content and the section border radius - implemented.
   * The contact form sends without a valid email address and phone number - implemented.
   * Remove the call to action (header) at the top of the servivce pages so you can immedialtely see the information you've clicked for rather than scrolling again - this is a single user prefrence and I will look to implement this on a later release once I have a larger quantity of user feedback.
   * One image on the Flowers & Trees page had a broken link and needed fixing - implemented.
   * The section border radius on all pages were blending into one another and needed space between them, the navigation bar and the footer - implemented.
   * On a mobile device in landscape orientation the content overlaps one another - I am aware of this and given there are very few users who will navigate this site in a mobile landscape orientation I will fix this in a future release.
   * On a Iphone the carousel slides the same content in twice - I am aware of this and through my research I have concluded that this is due to a bug in ios 13 and cannot be fixed at this stage.
   * The Orange and Green colours in the footer have very low contrast which could be an issue for accessability - Will look to make changes in the future releases.


### User Review

The general feedback was positive. Most people commenting on how much fun it was visually and easy to navigate.


#### Suggested Improvements:

   * Maybe better to have the Services section in the Navigation bar with the rest of the links - Will look to implement in a future release if there is enough user feedback.
   * On a mobile device in landscape orientation the content overlaps one another - I am aware of this and given there are very few users who will navigate this site in a mobile landscape orientation I will fix this in a future release.
   * On an Iphone the carousel slides the same content in twice - 

#### Conclusion

   * I am aware of the Iphone bug and through my research I have concluded that this is due to a bug in ios 13 and cannot be fixed at this stage.
   * I will use an analytics platform on the first release, such as [Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com/), to collect feedback form a larger range of users and use that data to implement changes related to the way users navigate the site.
