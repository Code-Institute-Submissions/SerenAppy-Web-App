## Introduction

SerenAppy is a meditation web app which has been built for a local community Health & Wellbeing centre. It will be used during meditation sessions in conjuction with yoga classes.

It presents a landing page with options for how long the user wishes to mediatate for (time) and what visual and audio experience the user prefers (season). The user can select from the following options:
### Time
* 2 minutes
* 5 minutes
* 10 minutes
* 20 minutes 
* 30 minutes
* 60 minutes

### Season
* Spring
* Summer
* Autumn
* Winter

The time selection sets how long the video and audio will last before it stops and the season selection will set the video and audio that the user would associate with the season chosen.

If only one selection is made the user will see a alert box prompting them to choose a time and season option.

The main purpose of the web app is to allow public funded health & well being initiatives and bodies to access an easy to use mediataion tool for people from all walks of life.

The web app can be viewed on Desktop, Tablet and Mobile devices.

### Minimum Viable Product

All the User Stories have been assessed against value and complexity on the chart below. Due to the relatively short time for the implementation of the web app, only the MVPs will be implemented in the first release of the web app.

[User Stories evaluation](documentation/mvp/user_stories.md)


**Explanation of the chart**

* The top area of the chart has been given the higher priority of implementation because it represents the most important features including:
  * Colour scheme and design.
  * Simple to follow instructions
  * Intercative and showing real time feedback to the user.
  * Easy to use audio and timer function controls.
  * Allowing users to interact with the supplier.
  * Responsive Web app.
* I have addressed all of the high value and high/low complexity in the first release.
* The features with high complexity and low value have been postponed for future updates/releases.

### Design

#### Colors

Following colours have been used:
* ![#CD853F](https://placehold.it/15/CD853F/000000?text=+) #CD853F (Peru) 
* ![#C76302](https://placehold.it/15/C76302/000000?text=+) #C76302 (Tawny) 
* ![#D2B48C](https://placehold.it/15/D2B48C/000000?text=+) #D2B48C (Tan) 
* ![#5f9ea0](https://placehold.it/15/5f9ea0/000000?text=+) #5f9ea0 (Cadet Blue) 
* ![#8B4513](https://placehold.it/15/8B4513/000000?text=+) #8B4513 (Saddle Brown)    
* ![#6c757d](https://placehold.it/15/6c757d/000000?text=+) #6c757d (Light Grey) 
* ![#E6F4F1](https://placehold.it/15/E6F4F1/000000?text=+) #E6F4F1 (Clear Day) 




The stand out colour for this web page is Cadet Blue, which according to [Color Psychology](https://www.colorpsychology.org/teal/) is associated with the ocean and nature. This concept is very relevant for a web app associated with meditation and seeking to create a relaxed state of mind.

Other than Cadet Blue, I used Peru for all of the buttons which have a Tawny border and when hovered on the button colour changes to Tan and the text changes to Saddle Brown. For the header and footer text I have used Tawny. For the Time and Season titles, all of the button text and the form text boxes I have used the colour Clear Day. When you hover on the media icons and the text links in the footer they change to Cadet Blue. Both the header and footer have a colour gradient applied which blends the colours Cadet Blue and Clear Day. All modals have Peru as their background colour, Clear Day for all text, boxes and Cadet Blue for buttons and the button `hover` and clicked changes the colour to Raven. The countdown timer on each meditation page is represented with numbers using the colour Saddle Brown. I have two sweet alert pop ups to confirm the users actions, these pop ups have their own default colours.

#### Font

The Fonts I used for this project are **Pacifico** and **Sans Serif** with the font weights: 
* 400 - for all button text and subtext.
* 500 - for headers and titles.

The [Pacifico](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pacifico) font was chosen for its soft calming design.

### Wireframes

I decided that it would be more helpful to have mockups than simple wireframes. The mockups were built in [figma](https://www.figma.com/). 

Link to the mockups can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/ld7rwps08gZCxYCipi7M3o/SerenAppy?node-id=0%3A1). The mockups were designed for the mobile first approach. I have produced a desktop and mobile mockup of the landing page. For the meditation pages I have only produced mobile mockups as the layout will remain the same on all screen sizes.

If you are unable to access the mockup links above please see the mockup images [here](https://github.com/Gmanprodev/SerenAppy-Web-App/tree/master/documentation/wireframes).

## Features

### Existing Features

#### Elements seen on the landing page.

* **Layout and Style**
    * I wanted the web app to have an appearance that was associated with natural elements, such as water, wood and the sky. My aim was to provide users with an instant sense of calm as soon as the web app had loaded, with the colour scheme and fonts used I believe I have been able to achieve this. Given this site is a web app and is purely there to interact with the users senses, I wanted to keep the text elements as simple as possible by limiting the amount of text that is used. The layout is a basic use of columns and rows which keeps the buttons in a consistent grid format that changes from multiple columns on larger screens to one column on smaller screens.

* **Navigation bar**
    * Has a `fixed` position on screen heights greater than 580px, to ensure that the logo can always be seen by the user, and a `absolute` postion on screen heights less than 580px to ensure there is enough content on the screen at any one time.
    * A SerenAppy logo in the left corner which also serves as a link to resfresh the landing page. The logo remains the same on all screen sizes.
    * The navbar background colour has ben built using a CSS gradient scheme to seamlessly move from one colour into another.

* **Footer**
    * Copyright information.
    * Web app built by information (linked to Marc Gulliver Linkedin profile).
    * Web app address (linked to web app landing page).
    * Social media links - facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Youtube (linked to relevant login page).
    * @ icon linked to an emailjs contact form modal.

* **How To Use SerenAppy Button**
    * This button displays in the colour Peru with the text displaying in the colour Clear Day, the button changes to the colour Tan and the text changes to Saddle Brown when on `hover`. This button opens a pop up modal which has written instructions on how to use the web app.

* **Select Time Buttons**
    * The buttons are presented in two columns beneath the heading "Select Time", the two columns reduce to one column on screen sizes less than 768px. The "Select Time" header is displayed in the colour Clear Day. Each button is displayed in the colour Peru with the text displaying in the colour Clear Day, the button changes to the colour Tan and the text changes to Saddle Brown when on `hover`. There are six "Select Time" buttons, each represents a set number of minutes (2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60). The selected time is passed through to the meditation page using Javascript and displays as a countdown timer. The user can only select one button at a time.

* **Select Season Buttons**
    * The buttons are presented in two columns beneath the heading "Select Season", the two columns reduce to one column on screen sizes less than 768px. The "Select Season" header is displayed in the colour Clear Day. Each button is displayed in the colour Peru with the text displaying in the colour Clear Day, the button changes to the colour Tan and the text changes to Saddle Brown when on `hover`. There are four "Select Season" buttons, each represents a season (spring, summer, autumn, winter). The selected season is passed through to the meditation page using Javascript and displays the associated image and audio. The user can only select one button at a time.

* **GO Button**
    * This button is round and centred at the bottom of the page. The button is displayed in the colour Peru with the text displaying in the colour Clear Day, the button changes to the colour Tan and the text changes to Saddle Brown when on `hover`. The Go button combines the time and the season selected and uses Javascript to create and display the meditation page for the user. If only one selection is made or no selections are made the user will see a Sweet Alert pop up modal which displays "Error" and explains what steps need to be taken.

* **Hidden Pages**
    * To increase the loading speed and reduce the users data usage the web app operates from a single html file (landing page). In the index.html file there is a `div` which holds all of the meditation page information and is hidden when the landing page loads. The information in this hidden `div` is replaced with the asscoiated image, audio and time based on the users selections, using Javascript. When the GO button is clicked the entire landing page is hidden and replaced with the meditation page using Javascript. 

* **How To Use SerenAppy - Modal**
    * The modal takes up 80% of the page and is displayed in the centre of the page. The modal has a background colour of Peru, all text is the colour Clear Day and the button is Cadet Blue which changes to a light grey colour when on `hover` and when clicked. The modal has two ways of closing, either click the close button in the bottom right corner or click the `x` in the top right corner. 

* **Contact Form - Modal**
    * The modal takes up 80% of the page and is displayed in the centre of the page. The modal has a background colour of Peru, all text is the colour Clear Day, the field boxes have a Cadet Blue border, the field box text is black and the submit button is Cadet Blue which changes to a light grey colour when on `hover` and when clicked. You can close the modal by clicking the `x` in the top right corner. You can submit the form by clicking the submit button, which is centred, at the bottom of the modal. All fields are validated so users can't submit the form with empty fields, also the email address is validated by using the `pattern` attribute within the html code which determines if the email format is correct or not. After clicking the submit button, with all fields correctly filled out, the user will see a Sweet Alert modal pop up informing the user of whether the email has been successfully sent or not. If all fields have been correctly filled out, when the submit button is clicked the fields are cleared and reset.

#### Elements seen on all meditation pages.

* **Landing page**
    * 

* **About Us page**
    * Has text and an image showing work that has been completed.

* **Location page**
    * Has company address and interactive google map to show the company location.

* **Completed Projects page**
    * Has a gallery containing 15 images, by clicking on an image the image will show on a full screen. Images were re-sized to 728x485 to enhance the visual appearence and flow to the page.

* **Contact Us page**
    * Has a form which asks for contact information and a message. The form boxes have Orange borders rather than a background colour to identify the text areas.

* **Service pages**
    * Has two columns of text, listing the services avaialble and a Bootstrap carousel with images of completed work relevant to that service page. At the bottom of the page is the Services menu where you can navigate to another service page.

### Features left to implement

* **Prices page** - To enable potential customers to estimate what a project or piece of work may cost.
* **Payment Procedure page** - To enable customers to understand what the costs involved before, during and on completion of the project or work.
* **Tracking User Behaviour** - Use an analytics tool such as [Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com/) to view user behaviour.
* **Most and Least Visited Pages on the Site** - Use an analytics tool such as [Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com/) to understand where the traffic is going on the site.


### Bugs and Fixes for Future Releases After Testing

* **Bootstrap Carousel** - After some research I found there to be a bug on ios13 (apple products) that makes each carousel slide move in twice. I believe this can be fixed with writing additional JavaScript for future releases.
* **Favicon** - The DevTool Console showed an error as I didn't have time to install a Favicon for the first release. This will be part of the next release. 
* **Colour Contrasts** - The Lighthouse Audit Chrome extension highlighted that the colours used on the site are too similar and could cause an issue for accessability. These issues will be addressed in the next release.
* **Website Address in Footer** - The website address for mrdigbee does not currently exist and does not link to another page. This will be addressed in the next release.
* **Social Media Links in Footer** - The social media icons are linked to the correct pages, however these are currently generic login pages. These will direct you to the company specific pages in future releases.
* **Mobile Lanscape View** - On some pages, when viewing on a mobile in landscape orientation, the call to action section at the top of the page can be cut off by the Navigation bar and the footer content is pushed on top of each other. This will be fixed on the next release.
